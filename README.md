# Audio Processing Application

This project is a Python-based application designed for capturing audio, extracting entropy from the audio data, generating a random number based on the entropy, and saving the audio file. Its modular design makes it suitable for use as a lightweight API, although it's primarily an application.

## Features

- Capture audio from the microphone.
- Extract entropy from the captured audio.
- Generate a random number based on the extracted entropy.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.6)
- pip

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

1. Start the application by running `python main.py`.
2. The application will begin capturing audio and processing it according to its functionality.
3. The processed audio will be saved as a WAV file in the project directory.
